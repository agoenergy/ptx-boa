**What sustainability aspects should be considered for PTX products, production and policies?**

**What questions should be asked before and during project development?**

In this tab we aim to provide a basic approach to these questions. The diagram shows the framework along which the compilation of sustainability aspects in this tab is structured. It is based on the EESG framework as elaborated by the PtX Hub and sustainability criteria developed by the Ã–ko-Institut.

**The framework distinguishes four key sustainability dimensions - Environmental, Economic, Social and Governance - from which you can select below.**

Within each of these dimensions there are different clusters of sustainability aspects that we address in a set of questions. We differentiate between questions indicating guardrails and questions suggesting goals.

With this compilation, we aim to provide a general overview of the sustainability issues that may be relevant in the context of PTX production. Of course, different aspects are more or less important depending on the project, product and country.

**Take a look for yourself to see which dimensions are most important from where you are coming from.**

This table shows aggregated results of the optimization:

- the installed generation, electrolyzer and derivative production capacities and their annual output that are required to produce 8760 MWh of final product per year
- the realized full load hours of said components  
- the curtailment of renewable generation
- the costs per MWh of final product.

Please note that transportation is not part of the optimization model. The costs shown here (unlike those in the **Costs** tab) are per MWh of final product produced in the supply country,  and do not include costs or losses during transportation.

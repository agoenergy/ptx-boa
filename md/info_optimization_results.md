This table shows aggregated results of the optimization:

- the installed generation, electrolyzer and derivative production capacities and their annual output that are required to produce 8760 MWh of final product per year
- the realized full load hours of said components  
- the curtailment of renewable generation
- the costs per MWh of final product.

Please note that transportation is not part of the optimization model. The costs shown here (unlike those in the **Costs** tab) are per MWh of final product produced in the supply country,  and do not include costs or losses during transportation.

Please note that if Green Iron is selected as product, other units are used:

- Capacity: t/h instead of MW
- Output: t/a instead of MWh/a
- Cost: USD/t instead of USD/MWh

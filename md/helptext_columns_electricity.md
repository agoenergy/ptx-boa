Some processes consume electricity. We assume that all electricity needs to be generated by the renewable electricity source that delivers electricity to the electrolyzer. Because of this, there is no need to define an electricity price.

The electricity consumption of electrolyzers is not defined here, but as **efficiency** in the **Conversion processes** section.

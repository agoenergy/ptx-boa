##### Country fact sheets

This sheet provides you with additional information on the production and import of  hydrogen and derivatives in all PTX BOA supply and demand countries. For each selected supply and demand country pair, you will find detailed  country profiles.

For demand countries, we cover the following aspects:  country-specific projected hydrogen demand, target sectors for hydrogen use,  hydrogen-relevant policies and competent authorities,  certification and regulatory frameworks,  and country-specific characteristics as defined in the demand countries'  hydrogen strategies.

For the supplying countries, we cover the country-specific technical potential for renewables (based on various data sources), LNG export and import infrastructure,  CCS potentials, availability of an H2 strategy and wholesale electricity prices.

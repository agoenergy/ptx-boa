### What functionalities does this tool provide to users?

- Get an impression of **total costs of delivered hydrogen and various derivative molecules** of your country of interest to a potential demand country
- Analyze the **cost components** of flexibly selectable process chains and production routes
- **Compare costs** between various production pathways, supply and demand countries on a global scale
- Access comprehensive **additional context information** on relevant aspects for PTX trade such as potential sustainability issues and certification
- If required, **adjust data points** according to your own level of knowledge

### On the level of detail

The tool calculates **simple levelized costs of hydrogen and derivatives** at screening/pre-feasbility level.
The table below (Agora & Umlaut 2023) gives an overview on different levels of cost/price approximations.
In this overview, the tool locates in first level which aims at providing high-level analyses at pre-feasibility level to start the discussion.
It does not show realized project costs or hydrogen and derivative prices.

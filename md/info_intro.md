### About this app

The PTX Business Opportunity Analyser is an interactive web app, designed to identify regions with promising business opportunities within the PtX value chain.

The app aims to promote the export of a wide range of PtX molecules, including amongst others, green ammonia, e-methanol and synthetic fuels. Users can calculate the delivered cost of PtX molecules from an export country to an import country, with a detailed cost breakdown comparison highlighting the competitive edge of one country against another.

The app comes with a default dataset for all included countries to guide the user and provide a high-level overview using pre-feasibility level information, while also allowing the user to manually adjust all relevant variables to accommodate local inputs. Moreover, the app connects the techno-economic analysis with relevant information on certification schemes and sustainability issues.

### Quick guide

- The **tab navigation bar** right below the app title lets you navigate between different sections of the app.
- In the **sidebar**, on the left side of screen, you can change all important settings. You can adjust the width of the sidebar or close it completely if you are using a small screen.

##### What to find where?

Here is a list of tabs and what you can find there:

- **Info:** (this is what you are currently reading) This tab contains general information on the app and the methodology behind it.
- **Dashboard:** lets you compare the costs of producing different molecules and exporting them to different countries.
- **Market scanning:** provides an overview of competing supply countries and potential demand countries you might want to export to.
- **Input data:** shows the data that goes into the calculations and lets you modify it.
- **Deep-dive countries:** For three countries (Argentina, Morocco and South Africa) this tab shows you input data and costs on a higher regional resolution.
- **Country fact sheets:** gives you contextual information on the selected demand and supply countries, along with links for further reading.
- **Certification schemes**: contains information on standards, regulation and certification schemes around PtX
- **Sustainability:** provides information on sustainability aspects that should be considered when working with PtX.
- **Literature:** contains a list of references for further reading.

##### General hints on how to use the app

- Figures are interactive: You can click on legend entries to hide / unhide them, and moving your mouse over figure elements displays helpful information.
- Data tables are also interactive: At the top right of each data table there are small widgets for maximizing it, searching for strings, or downloading the table in csv format.
- Additionally, below most data tables you'll find a button that lets you export the content as an Excel file.

##### Editing input data

You can edit most input data that goes into the calculations. To activate data edit mode, you need to toggle the respective switch at the bottom of the sidebar. If you do so, you can edit the data in the tables on the **Input data** tab. At the top of the screen, you will see an overview of the changes you made, and the option to download changes to file, or upload a file with changes from a previous session.

If you have modified the input data, you can choose in the **Dashboard** tab if you want to visualize the results based on the original data, the modified data, or the difference between both.

You can revert all data back to  default by turnin data edit mode off again.

### What functionalities does this app provide to users?

- Get an impression of **total costs of delivered hydrogen and various derivative molecules** of your country of interest to a potential demand country
- Analyze the **cost components** of flexibly selectable process chains and production routes
- **Compare costs** between various production pathways, supply and demand countries on a global scale
- Access comprehensive **additional context information** on relevant aspects for PTX trade such as potential sustainability issues and certification
- If required, **adjust data points** according to your own level of knowledge

### On the level of detail

The app calculates **simple levelized costs of hydrogen and derivatives** at screening/pre-feasbility level.
The table below (Agora & Umlaut 2023) gives an overview on different levels of cost/price approximations.
In this overview, the app locates in first level which aims at providing high-level analyses at pre-feasibility level to start the discussion.
It does not show realized project costs or hydrogen and derivative prices.

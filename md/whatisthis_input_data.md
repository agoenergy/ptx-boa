##### Input data

This tab gives you an overview of model input data that is country-specific.

First you get an overview of data that is region specific: CAPEX, full load hours of renewables, and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). For CAPEX and full load hours you can choose which source to display in map and data tables.

Next follows a list of global input data (that is not region specific). It is structured by expandable sections, each one containing a data table.

You can edit all data tables in this tab when activating data edit mode (at the bottom of the sidebar).

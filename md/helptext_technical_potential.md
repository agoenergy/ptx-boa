Please note that many assumptions are needed to estimate technical RE potentials. Data across sources varies significantly, and not all PtXBOA supply regions are covered by the two sources used here.

If a supply region is not covered by the source, it will not show up in the diagram. Please choose "None" to show all supply regions.

If you select a deep-dive country subregion as source region, it will show up in the diagram, and the potential of the country it belongs to will be divided equally across all subregions of this country.

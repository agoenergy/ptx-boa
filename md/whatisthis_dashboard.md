##### The dashboard

This tab shows the main results of the app: the costs of producing and exporting molecules according to your settings.

- The map on top shows you the cost of exporting your chosen product to your chosen demand country.
- Next to the map, you get an overview of the regional distribution of costs and a split-up of costs by category for your chosen supply region.
- Below, you get a comparison of costs by supply region, data scenario, electricity source and supply chain.

If you make modifications to the input data, you can choose for each graph to display results with modifications, without modifications, or the difference between both.

Switch to other tabs to explore data and results in more detail!
